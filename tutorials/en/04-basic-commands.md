2. Add navigation bar
3. Add statistics cards
4. Apply blue theme

Claude: Okay, I'll complete these tasks in order...
```

### Conditional Operations

```
You: If config.js exists, update it; otherwise create a new one

Claude: I checked, the file doesn't exist, I'll create a new one...
```

### Reference Previous Content

```
You: Create a login page

[Claude creates login page]

You: Create a registration page using the same style

Claude: Okay, I'll use the same design style as the login page...
```

## 12. Advanced Tips

### Use Context

```
You: Remember this design specification:
- Primary color: #3498db
- Font: Roboto
- Border radius: 8px

Claude: Okay, I've remembered these design specifications

You: Create a button component using this specification

Claude: [Creates button using specified design specifications]
```

### Multi-file Collaboration

```
You: Create a user management module that needs:
- user.html display page
- user.js business logic
- user.css styles
- They should work together

Claude: I'll create these three files and ensure they're properly linked...
```

### Templates and Scaffolding

```
You: Create a React component template that I can reuse later

Claude: [Creates reusable component template]

You: Create a Header component based on this template

Claude: [Generates new component using template]
```

## 13. Avoid Common Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Operating Too Quickly

‚ùå Poor Practice:
```
You: Create index.html
You: Add navigation bar
You: Add footer
You: Modify color
[Continue making requests without waiting for Claude to complete]
```

‚úÖ Good Practice:
```
You: Create index.html
[Wait for Claude to complete]
You: Add navigation bar
[Wait for completion and check]
You: Add footer
...
```

### Mistake 2: Not Checking Results

‚ùå Poor Practice:
```
Claude: File created
You: [Immediately make next request]
```

‚úÖ Good Practice:
```
Claude: File created
You: Look at the content of index.html
[Check and confirm]
You: Good, continue...
```

### Mistake 3: Vague Description

‚ùå Poor Practice:
```
You: Modify the style
```

‚úÖ Good Practice:
```
You: Change the button's background color to blue and font size to 16px
```

## 14. Efficient Collaboration Modes

### Teaching Mode

```
You: Can you teach me how this code works? Explain step by step

Claude: Of course, let me explain in detail:
Line 1: Define function...
Line 2: Check parameters...
...
```

### Exploration Mode

```
You: What are the ways to implement image lazy loading?

Claude: There are several common methods:
1. Intersection Observer API
2. scroll event listening
3. Third-party libraries like lazysizes
Each method's pros and cons are...
```

### Decision Support

```

Based on [project characteristics], I suggest...
Because...
```
