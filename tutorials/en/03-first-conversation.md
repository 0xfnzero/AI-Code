- ‚úÖ "Make a website to showcase my photography work, with image display and work descriptions"

**2. Explain Your Needs**
- ‚ùå "This doesn't work"
- ‚úÖ "Can you make the font bigger? I think it's too small right now"

**3. Step by Step**
- ‚ùå Give 10 requirements at once
- ‚úÖ Complete basic functionality first, then optimize gradually

**4. Provide Examples**
```
Help me make a login page that's simple like the Apple website
```

Claude: I've added a circular avatar container, you can replace it with your own photo...
```

## 3. Understanding Claude Code's Workflow

### What Does Claude Code Do?

When you say "create a personal business card webpage", Claude Code will:

**1. Understand Requirements**
- Analyze what you want
- Determine which files are needed

**2. Create Files**
```
üìÅ Creating index.html - webpage structure
üìÅ Creating style.css - style design
üìÅ Creating script.js - interactive functionality (if needed)
```

**3. Write Code**
- Automatically write HTML structure
- Design CSS styles
- Add necessary functionality

**4. Tell You the Results**
```
‚úÖ Created index.html
‚úÖ Created style.css
üí° You can open index.html in your browser to view the result
```

### View Created Files

**Method 1: Use Code Editor**
```bash
# If you have VS Code installed
code .
```

**Method 2: Preview in Browser**
- Find the project folder
- Double-click `index.html`
- Browser will open automatically

**Method 3: View Code Content**
```bash
# Mac/Linux
cat index.html

# Windows
type index.html
```

## 4. Common Interaction Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Modify Content

```
You: Change "Designer" to "UI/UX Designer"

Claude: Title has been updated...
```

### Scenario 2: Adjust Styles

```
You: The background is too bright, can you make it darker?

Claude: Background brightness has been reduced...
```

### Scenario 3: Add Functionality

```
You: When clicking the email, can it directly open the email client?

Claude: I've added a mailto link...
```

### Scenario 4: Explain Code

```
You: What does this CSS code do?

Claude: This code creates a flex layout container,
centers the content on the page, and sets padding and margins...
```

### Scenario 5: Fix Issues

```
You: Why isn't my avatar showing up?

Claude: Let me check... It's because the image path is incorrect,
you should put the image in the project folder and make sure the filename matches...
```
